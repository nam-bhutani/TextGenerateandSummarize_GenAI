# Text Summarization and Generation using Generative AI

This project leverages the power of pre-trained Transformer models to develop a system capable of performing both text summarization and generation. It utilizes GPT-2 XL for text generation and Facebook's BART Large CNN for text summarization, integrated within a user-friendly interface built using Gradio.

## Features

- **Text Generation:** Generate human-quality text based on user prompts, utilizing the GPT-2 XL model.
- **Text Summarization:** Create concise and informative summaries of long documents using the BART Large CNN model.
- **Interactive Interface:** A Gradio-based interface allows users to easily input text for generation or summarization and view the results.
